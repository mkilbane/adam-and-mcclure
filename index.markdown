The Voice in Extremity: Michael McClure, Helen Adam, and the Digital Lyric Archive 

1.	

The ever-accelerating digitization of poetry’s audio archive has made possible for communities of poetic practice and scholarship over the last two decades a range of new objects for inquiry and new methods of analysis. Online archives like UbuWeb, PennSound, and SpokenWeb among  others have enabled critics, for instance, to snatch the literary concept “voice” from the phenomenalist realm of metaphor and make it conspicuously concrete, opening the sonorous speech of poet-performers to digital tools that allow us to listen differently, raising and answering new questions about the history of modern and contemporary poetry. 

The present set of annotated recordings happily participates in these ongoing developments by inviting readers to listen in detail to artifacts from two digital archives—SpokenWeb and the Naropa University Audio Archives—by means of a new and crucially enabling platform, AudiAnnotate, developed by Tanya Clement and Brumfield Labs. At the same time, I’ll use the opportunity to reflect in a somewhat more speculative mood on poetry’s “digital lyric archive,” my name for the tendentious sum total of these new tools, platforms, and virtual collections. In this case the contested word “lyric” serves not as a generic term, but instead as a strategy for foregrounding poetry’s rather peculiar media condition. “Lyric,” with its vestigial etymological gesture toward a now-absent lyre, points toward the historical fact that the reading and writing of poetry are practices structured in tension between writing or print, on the one hand, and various kinds of sonic phenomena, on the other. To foreground this unruly and unstable media condition in our study of poetry’s formal and social history is necessarily to expand the poetic archive--to arrange printed poems along variously mediated performances of those poems, and alongside other lyric objects even less familiar to literary critics: pop songs, libretti, phonograph records, tape reels, radio broadcasts, YouTube videos, etc. Because digital platforms make possible the co-presentation of text, sound, and image, these emerging collections and tools enable exploration of artifacts and practices that because they are “lyric”—because they are generatively riven by a tension between sound and writing—have never been fully at home in print. 

But what does it mean to study older media artifacts, from the printed poem to the tape-recorded poetry performance, via digital interfaces? What transformative possibilities and what latent, deforming incompatibilities emerge in the confrontation between the longer intermedial history of poetry—a history we can flag with the word “lyric”—and the digital technologies that allow us to read (and see, and hear) that history like never before?

It seems that the harder one looks at the digital lyric archive, the harder it is to theorize. But one way of defining its contours is to say what it’s not. And that, it turns out, is instructively easy.

In one of the two annotated recordings linked below, listeners will hear the American poet Michael McClure read from Ghost Tantras (1964), a collection of poems that dip in and out of what McClure calls “beast language,” an ecstatic register of leonine nonsense that mimics the growls and roars of large mammals. Rather infamously, McClure recited selections from Ghost Tantras for actual lions at the San Francisco Zoo, a spectacle captured on film for a 1966 episode of the television program USA: Poetry.  

Ten years later, however, during this particular at the Naropa Institute, McClure makes a show of his hesitance to read Ghost Tantra 49, the very same poem that he had triumphantly declaimed to an audience of lions a decade prior:  

"I was always afraid to recite this other one. Although I knew it by heart, I was afraid to recite it because I thought I might not be able to stop. It's very mantric. And I thought I'd be giving a reading and they'll carry me away at the end. I'll still be going Grahhr! Grahhr!"

Joking or not, McClure attributes his eventual resolution to read the poem to a recent experience of forced isolation: 

"Recently I was in one of John Lilly’s isolation tanks and I thought, what a perfect time to do this thing I've always been afraid to do. What difference would it make here? So I did, and I did know it by heart, but I think I'll read it here anyway."

The reference to Lilly, the countercultural scientist, is curiously overdetermined….


---->The rest of Part Two reads Lilly’s isolation tank as a kind of anti-model for the recorded poetry performance—a model for the idealistic experience of a poem on the page—to which McClure instructively reacts in this reading at Naropa. I then use the anti-isolation tank model of the poetry reading to examine three affordances of the digital lyric archive when elaborated with the tools of AudiAnnotate: the reading voice (the performative relationship between voice and absent page), the situated voice (the documentary relationship between a speaking voice and its particular audience), and the social voice (the embodied relationship between a speaking voice and its own social history). I then introduce the two readings by McClure and Helen Adam and summarize my findings along these three axes, though the “close readings” will be performed in the annotations themselves—or more specifically, in the unfolding relationship between the annotations and the actual sonic text.
