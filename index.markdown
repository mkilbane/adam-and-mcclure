Whatever else the ever-accelerating digitization of modern poetry’s audio archive has made possible for communities of poetic practice and scholarship over the last two decades—and its implications are far-reaching indeed—it has certainly snatched the concept of voice from the phenomenalist realm of literary metaphor and made it conspicuously concrete. When we click play on UbuWeb, PennSound, SpokenWeb, or to the New Yorker Poetry Podcast, and we listen to voices. One result has been new objects of scholarly inquiry—“poet’s voice,” for instance—and new tools and methods for analysis. Thankfully there have been no shortages of groundbreaking work on this front—work that takes these new archives, objects, and tools, and puts them to work.
